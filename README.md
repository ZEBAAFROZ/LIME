# Lime (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)

![Lime Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcotcr/lime/master/doc/images/lime.png)

## Introduction

**Lime** is a Python library for creating local, interpretable machine learning models that help explain the predictions made by complex machine learning models. It stands for **Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations**, and its primary goal is to provide insights into the inner workings of a model, making it easier for humans to understand and trust AI systems.

Machine learning models, especially deep learning models, can be challenging to interpret. They often work as "black boxes," where understanding why they make certain predictions is difficult. Lime addresses this issue by approximating the decision boundaries of a model using a simpler, more interpretable model (e.g., linear regression) on a local neighborhood of the input data.

## Features

- **Model Agnostic**: Lime works with any machine learning model, regardless of whether it's a deep neural network, random forest, or support vector machine.

- **Local Interpretability**: Lime provides explanations for individual predictions, helping users understand why a particular instance was classified as it was.

- **Flexible**: Lime supports various data types, including text, images, and tabular data, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

- **Customizable**: You can customize Lime's explainer models and sampling strategies to suit your specific use case.

## Getting Started

To get started with Lime, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install lime
```

You can then import Lime into your Python script or Jupyter Notebook and start creating explanations for your machine learning models.

```python
import lime
from lime.lime_tabular import LimeTabularExplainer

# Load your machine learning model and data
explainer = LimeTabularExplainer(training_data, mode="classification")

# Explain a prediction
explanation = explainer.explain_instance(input_instance, predict_function)
```
